For this project, I developed **Tantawawa Judge**, an attempt at creating a virtual judge in C# for competitive programming contests. This system is designed to automatically evaluate code submissions, providing instant feedback to participants, similar to how traditional competitive programming platforms work.

Tanta Judge focuses on evaluating correctness and performance, ensuring that submitted solutions meet the problem constraints in terms of time and memory usage. This virtual judge is a foundational attempt at building a system that could support real-time contest scenarios and improve the efficiency of competitive programming practice environments.

I was able to achieve a functional system that correctly evaluated solutions in most cases, with future enhancements planned to improve performance and extend language support.
