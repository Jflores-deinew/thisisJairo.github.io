      <description>For this project, I developed Tantawawa Judge, an attempt at creating a virtual judge in C# for competitive programming contests. This system is designed to automatically evaluate code submissions, providing instant feedback to participants, similar to how traditional competitive programming platforms work.&#xA;Tanta Judge focuses on evaluating correctness and performance, ensuring that submitted solutions meet the problem constraints in terms of time and memory usage. This virtual judge is a foundational attempt at building a system that could support real-time contest scenarios and improve the efficiency of competitive programming practice environments.</description>
